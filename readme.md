# Window Maker ðŸªŸ

Window maker is a simple C project that interacts with the windows OS. It makes a simple window with a few customisation options in the main function call.

Feel free to fork the repo and edit the code however you want, I wish you luck on your endeavors.

**This code is only going to work on Windows, as it interacts with the operating system**
